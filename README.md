# SmartHomeKushal
Smart Home Monitoring system using IOT.
This is based on a IOT device that is used to take the necessary parameters from outside and cultivate to the user.
This can be discussed over the segments of this device.
Let's come to the hardware parts of this--- 

1. Main part we use is the NodeMCU(esp8266). 
2. For electrical apllience control we use a single channel relay
3. Sensors like DHT11 (Humidity and Temparetue)
4. Fire sensor module
5. PIR motion sensor
6. LDR light sensor(Build on board not using module)
7. For output we use LCD with I2C converter(For less hazar and less pin manupulation)
8. Some notification leds
9. Jumper wires
10. Header pins
